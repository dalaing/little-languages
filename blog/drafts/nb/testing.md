# A new suite of generators

## Well typed terms

## Ill typed terms

## Terms containing other terms

# Writing the properties

## Progress

## Preservation

## Double-checking our generators

As usual, we should try some things out in the REPL.

TODO going right
TODO type errors, and their horribleness
TODO link to page on srclocs

# Exercises for the adventurous
